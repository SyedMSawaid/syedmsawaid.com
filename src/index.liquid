  Hi, my name is Sawaid. I am a Software Engineer based in Pakistan. I work at
  <a href="https://geekspod.co/">GeeksPod</a> as a Senior Software Engineer.
</p>

<p>
  This is my blog where I share my learnings in life and otherwise. My latest post is
  <a href="{{ lastest_post.relative_url }}">{{ lastest_post.data.title }}</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I stream on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/syedmsawaid">Twitch</a> while building my side projects hoping one day I
  will get to share them with the world. Currently I am building a Journaling app for myself.
