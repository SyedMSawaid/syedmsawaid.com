So I achieved a lot of things this year. Some of the notables are

- Lose weight (got from 125kgs to 95kgs. Infact lost 10 kgs just in december thanks to water fasting)
- Moved to Germany to pursue my masters
- Joined Hackerspace Marburg and got to work on projects.
- Made German friends (which was easy to be honest, I don't know what the fuss is all about making German friends being hard)
- Started learning new language i.e. German
- Landed a working student job in couple of months
- And the best thing, started to getting to know myself and finally getting independent.
