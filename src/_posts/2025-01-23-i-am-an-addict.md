I am finally coming to terms with myself that I am an addict.

I am addicted to social media and YouTube.

I am addicted to X and Bluesky.

I am addicted to sugar and junk food.

I am addicted to few other things I am embarrassed to share online. But it is clear that I am an addict.

I decide to work on my goals, my side projects and read books. But I end up spending time on things I don’t care about.

I decide to lose weight and fast, only to end up consuming sugar and junk food.

On top of that, I always have excuses up ready for it. With junk food and sugar, I say “one last time” before I leave it for good.

It takes special form of mental gymnastics to convince yourself you are not addicted when you have been drinking half to 1 liter of coke every day for the last 7 years.

It is embarrassing to write this, but its time should stop lying to myself.
