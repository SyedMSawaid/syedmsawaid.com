It's been 1 week and apart from a couple of days, I haven't really followed up on my goals and habits. Currently, there is too much going on in my life. I am in a process of moving to another country and getting all the documents ready is no joke, especially if you are from Pakistan.

These obligations along with failing my daily tasks were stressing me out. Pair that with anxiety and now you are a deer in front of headlights. Plus more things are coming up as I prepare myself to leave for Germany.

For now, I am going to stop working on all my goals/habits. If I get time, I will freestyle them. But for now, I am not going to pursue them in a organized way.

I haven't ran a successful Dark Mode completely to pass a judgement if it is useful or not. May be sometimes in the future I will go through it, but I am dropping it for now.
