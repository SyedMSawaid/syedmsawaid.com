When I launched this blog, my main goal was to build authority in the indie-hackers space. I want to communicate my thoughts and the phases I go through during my journey.

But I was lazy to write any post. You can see, the last post I published was around 6 months back. It was published in November, now we are talking in May. You can clearly see the lack of commitment. It was not that I don't want to write. The problem is that I want to write better from day one.

I still remember my journey of making vlogs on youtube, learning ASP.NET, and then learning Ruby on Rails.

If you see my first video and the last one I made, you can clearly see the difference in quality and story. The same was the case with ASP.NET and now, with Ruby on Rails. When I started Ruby on Rails, everything seems to be magic. I don't know how to organize my code and make it readable. My first version of SprintBYC written in Rails was a complete dumpster fire. Slowly, but surely, I improved my skills. The thing is, you can't learn something if you don't do it. We are wired to learn it by doing.

Also, it is a completely bullshit idea to be able to write a blog post as better as one who has been writing it for years. It is just an injustice to the person who has put in the hours. This whole idea of writing as better as the experienced guy is gross.

I don't want to live in a world where that is true. I know AI is making strides, but still, it is an injustice.

So I am deciding and committing to writing at least 3 blog posts each week. The topics can be sparse and vary from Ruby on Rails to personal philosophy and journaling. You might even get to see a monthly report on the first of every month where I might go through all the things I have learned or have been doing the past month.

In short, the idea is to write more to write better. Or do more to do better. There is just no other way I know off. It is simple as that.

Do more to do better
