It has been 1 week and apart from a couple of days, I haven't really followed up on [my goals and habits](_posts/2024-03-31-goals-for-april-2024-dark-mode-v1-1.md). Currently, there is too much going on in my life. I am in a process of moving to another country and getting all the documents ready is no joke, especially if you are from Pakistan.

These obligations along with failing my daily tasks were stressing me out. Pair that with anxiety and now I feel paralyzed like deer caught in the headlights. Plus more things are coming up as I prepare myself to leave for Germany.

I am going to stop working on all my goals/habits. If I get time, I will freestyle them. But for now, I am not going to pursue them in an organized way.

I haven't ran a successful Dark Mode completely to pass a judgement if it is useful or not. May be I will go through it sometimes in the future.
