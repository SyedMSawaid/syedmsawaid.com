After beating around the bush for so long, I think it is time for me to focus on achieving my goals. Goals that I had back in 2022. It is such a sad state that it took me almost 2 years to get to work on these goals. How can I expect to change my life when I don't even work for it.

The methodology or framework I will be using to achieve my goals is called Dark Mode. It is created by a YouTuber and businessman Nelson Quest who I look up to. His insights into self improvement and development are pure and unmatched.

Dark Mode is a framework where you go completely dark, such that you don't communicate with society. You disable your social media accounts or delete the apps. You don't do anything else expect working towards your goals. No social media apps, no YouTube, no Netflix, no books (except those that help you achieve this goal), no hangouts etc.

The idea is that you and only you are responsible for all the failures in your life. No amount of blaming absolve you from this responsibility.
