At the time of graduation, there was more demand for software engineers than for civil engineers in our country Pakistan. I don’t regret one bit of it. On the contrary, my parents are happy now that they have let me choose software engineering.

When I graduated, my parents wanted me to pursue a career in the Civil Services of Pakistan. I understand their reasoning, they weren’t wrong. But I don’t want to live that life.

I want to make cool shit and just be happy with that. I want to be around the people I choose to be around. I want to work with or for the people that I choose.

Why surrender the canvas of your existence to the strokes of another's thoughts when you possess the innate power to paint your life with the vibrant hues of your own convictions and desires?
