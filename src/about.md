title: About
---

I'm a software engineer, programmer and designer. I'm also a vlogger, gamer, Pakistani, and a bunch of other things.

My background is in Software Engineering. I studied software engineering with specialization in Web Technologies and Machine Learning from [COMSATS University Islamabad](http://www.comsats.edu.pk/). In 2021, I started my career with [TEO International Islamabad](https://www.teo-intl.com/) which shaped my professional work. There, I worked on a number of projects, internally and for customers, making a positive impact on a broader audience beyond myself. It inspired me to build meaningfully products for the better internet.

I currently work as Senior Software Engineer at [GeeksPod](https://www.geekspod.co/).

I use this website to share my ideas, notes and research on things I'm working on, mostly in the realms of technology, design, and education.
